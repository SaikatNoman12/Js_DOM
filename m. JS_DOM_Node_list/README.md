# JavaScript DOM NodeList

## What is NodeList?

NodeList is a object.

NodeList is an array like list.

A NodeList is a collection of document nodes (element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes).

NodeList items can only be accessed by their index number.

The querySelectorAll() method returns a static NodeList.

The childNodes property returns a live NodeList.

A NodeList may look like an array, but it is not.

We can loop through a NodeList and refer to its nodes by index.

But, We cannot use Array methods like push(), pop(), or join() on a NodeList.

The length property defines the number of nodes in a node list.
